       Logging of routing events in BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)
                       draft-ietf-grow-bmp-rel-04

Abstract

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) does provision for BGP session
   event logging (Peer Up, Peer Down), state synchronization (Route
   Monitoring), debugging (Route Mirroring) and Statistics messages,
   among the others.  This document defines a new Route Event Logging
   (REL) message type for BMP with the aim of covering use-cases with
   affinity to alerting, reporting and on-change analysis.

1.  Introduction

   As NLRIs are advertised and distributed, policies are applied and, as
   a result, actions are performed on them.  Currently, in order to
   infer the outcome of an evaluation process, a comparative analysis
   needs to be performed between Route Monitoring data for two distinct
   observation points of interest, for example Adj-Rib-In pre-policy and
   post-policy.  It would be instead more useful if a monitored router
   could export event-driven data with the relevant information.

Internet-Draft                   BMP REL                  September 2025


   The envisioned use-cases are the most diverse and range from logging
   route filtering to reporting the outcome of validation processes
   taking place on the monitored router, to isolating certain subsets of
   data to be validated offline, to report malformed BGP packets, to
   broader closed-loop operations.

   This document defines a new Route Event Logging (REL) message type
   that is suitable to carry event-driven data and is extensible in
   nature.  While the message format is similar to the Route Mirroring
   message type defined in RFC 7854 [RFC7854] and to the Route
   Monitoring message type as defined in [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv], the
   semantics are different.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC 2119 [RFC2119] RFC 8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

3.  Route Event Logging (REL) message

   In basic terms a REL message does carry Events.  Each Event is
   logically composed by one Event Subject and one or more Event
   Attributes.

   The structure of the Route Event Logging message is similar to the
   Route Monitoring message defined in [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv], as such
   all TLVs enclosed in the message are indexed.

   The message is composed of the Per-Peer Header, one mandatory BGP
   Message TLV, one mandatory Informational TLV indicating the reason of
   the event and any further optional Informational TLVs to better
   characterize the nature of the event.  An example of the indexed TLV
   structure is available in Appendix A of [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv].

   One or more Event Subjects are packed as part of the BGP Update PDU.
   The BGP Update PDU Section 4.3 of [RFC4271] is encoded itself as part
   of the BGP Message TLV with code point 4 and index set to zero.  Each
   Event Subject is represented by an NLRI carried in the PDU.

   The BGP Message TLV may be preceeded and/or followed by indexed
   Informational TLVs that carry Event Attributes, where attributes are
   bound to subjects referring to their positional index within the PDU
   or via a Group TLV as described in Section 5.2.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv]

Internet-Draft                   BMP REL                  September 2025


   Speaking comparatively to other existing message types, REL does not
   require an initial flooding of information as per the state
   synchronization nature of Route Monitoring and does not aim to
   provide a non-state-compressed full-fidelity view of all messages
   received as per the debugging nature of Route Mirroring.

   In the context of BMP REL message, and hence in the reminder of this
   document, the term Event Subject and NLRI will be used
   interchangeably.  Also the term Event Attribute and Informational TLV
   will be used interchangeably.

   The following sections will describe each component of the REL
   message in more detail.

3.1.  Per-Peer Header

   The message does start with a BMP per-peer header as defined in RFC
   7854 [RFC7854], subsequently extended by RFC 8671 [RFC8671] and RFC
   9069 [RFC9069] allowing, among the other things, to timestamp an
   Event and set its observation point among those defined in BMP.

   Because the main purpose of the REL message is to log events at the
   time of applying an action, the Peer Flags field - even if applied to
   Adj-Rib-In or Adj-Rib-Out does not have the concept of pre- and post-
   policy.  The flags are hence defined as follows:

                              0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                             |V|A| Reserved  |
                             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The V flag and A flag do carry the same meaning as originally defined
   by RFC 7854 [RFC7854].  The remaining bits are reserved for future
   use.  They MUST be transmitted as 0 and their values MUST be ignored
   on receipt.

3.2.  BGP Update PDU

   The PDU enclosed as part of a BGP Message TLV can be either a
   verbatim copy or artificial, either packed from scratch or repacked
   starting from an existing BGP Update PDU to only contain the relevant
   NLRIs affected by an Event (one or multiple).  The Event is going to
   be further described by means of Event Attributes by indexed
   Informational TLVs.

   The choice of describing one or multiple Event Subjects via a BGP
   Update PDU is because, on one hand, this does allow to not have to
   invent new encodings for NLRIs, while on the other, to support all

Internet-Draft                   BMP REL                  September 2025


   types and encodings already supported by BGP.  The advantage being
   that only minimal new code, on both the exporting and the receiving
   sides, will have to be produced.

3.3.  Informational TLVs

   Informational TLVs in BMP are formalized by the intersection of RFC
   7854 [RFC7854], [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] and
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit].  TLVs in a REL message are indexed.

   Contrary to other BMP messages where all Informational TLVs are
   entirely optional, in order for a REL message to be meaningful, it
   MUST contain at least one Event Reason TLV and MAY contain other
   optional attribute TLVs to further characterize the Event.

   A new registry called "Route Event Logging TLVs" is defined and is
   seeded with the TLVs detailed in the following sections.

3.3.1.  Event Reason TLV

   5 = Event Reason TLV (4 octets).  Indicates the IANA-registered
   reason code describing the type of the event.  The following reason
   codes are defined as part of the "Event Reason TLV" registry:

                       +========+==================+
                       | Value  | Event Reason     |
                       +========+==================+
                       | 0x0001 | Log Action       |
                       +--------+------------------+
                       | 0x0002 | Policy Discard   |
                       +--------+------------------+
                       | 0x0004 | Validation Fail  |
                       +--------+------------------+
                       | 0x0008 | Malformed Packet |
                       +--------+------------------+

                               Event reasons

3.3.2.  Log Action TLV

   6 = Log Action TLV.  The length is variable.  The first byte defines
   the nature of the logging, depending on the code point additional
   data may follow. the following code points are defined:

Internet-Draft                   BMP REL                  September 2025


   *  1 = Config.  Prefix is being logged due to a configuration
      statement.  Data contains a UTF-8 string whose value can be
      organized freely by an implementation and is meant to give
      additional information about why the log was made.

   *  2 = Route unstable.  Optional data contains a 4 bytes value
      representing the observed timeframe in seconds, followed by a 4
      bytes value indicating the amount of times the event occurred
      within the timeframe.

   *  3 = Crossed Warning Bound.  Prefix is over the warning threshold
      of the maximum number of prefixes that can be received from a BGP
      neighbor.  Data contains a 4 bytes value representing the
      threshold number.

   *  4 = Crossed Upper Bound.  Prefix is over the upper threshold of
      the maximum number of prefixes that can be received from a BGP
      neighbor.  Data contains a 4 bytes value representing the
      threshold number.

3.3.3.  Policy Discard TLV

   7 = Policy Discard TLV.  The length is variable.  The first byte of
   the value field indicates how the rest is organized:

   *  1 = String.  The value contains a UTF-8 string whose value can be
      organized freely by an implementation.  For example, it may
      contain the routing policy name that caused the discard; or it may
      list a sequence of policies and policy nodes traversed; or, more
      simply, it could be a meaningful return code.

   *  2 = Structured.  On the escort of Section 4 of [RFC9067] and YANG
      Model for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-4) [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model]
      the value is organized as two consecutive null-terminated strings,
      the first indicating the policy name, the second the statement
      name within the policy.

3.3.4.  Validation Fail TLV

   8 = Validation Fail TLV.  The length is set to 1 byte and the value
   represents a code giving more information about the specific
   validation fail.  Following are the defined code points:

   *  Code = 1: RPKI Invalid.  The prefix is being marked as RPKI
      'invalid' and either has no coverage or it is unknown whether it
      has coverage by a valid prefix.

Internet-Draft                   BMP REL                  September 2025


   *  Code = 2: RPKI Invalid with covering Valid prefix.  The NLRI is
      being marked as RPKI 'invalid' but is covered by a Valid prefix.

3.3.5.  Malformed Packet TLV

   9 = Malformed Packet TLV.  The length is set to 1 byte and the value
   represents a code giving more information about the specific
   malforming.  Following are the defined code points:

   *  Code = 1: Errored PDU.  The BGP message was found to have some
      error that made it unusable, causing it to be treated-as-withdraw
      RFC7606 [RFC7606].

3.4.  Group TLV

   The Group TLV is to form N:M relationships among NLRIs in the BGP
   Update PDU and TLVs of the same Route Event Logging message.  This
   TLV has code point 2 and follows the definition of Group TLV in
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv].

3.5.  Stateless Parsing TLV

   The Stateless Parsing TLV is to allow parsing of the BGP Update PDU
   independently from a Peer Up message previously received for the same
   BGP session.  This TLV can be especially relevant to Route Event
   Logging where the BGP Update PDU is artificial.  The TLV has code
   point 1 , it follows the definition of Stateless Parsing TLV in
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] and uses code point definitions in the
   Stateless Parsing Registry.

4.  Operational Considerations

   Route Event Logging messages are event-driven in nature so the
   general recommendation is to use them to report on specific
   conditions of interest in order, for example, to facilitate data
   mining or avoid differential analysis.  When the objective is to
   annotate every received or announced NLRI then the recommendation is
   to use Route Monitoring messages with BMP Path Marking
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-path-marking-tlv].  As an example consider RPKI
   validation status: when the objective is to report on any validations
   tatus (ie. valid, invalid and unknown), BMP Path Marking should be
   used; when the objective is instead to report only invalids then
   Route Event Logging with Validation Fail Event Reason should be used.

   There exist a definite overlap between Route Event Logging when used
   to report Malformed Packet and the use-cases for Route Mirroring
   where Errored PDUs may be sampled for reporting.  From implementors
   perspective, if one wants to implement broader event-driven

   notifications and does not want to offer exact mirroring of monitored
   BGP sessions without state compression it may be adviceable to prefer
   implementing Route Event Logging message type over Route Mirroring.
   From a collector perspective, similarly, one may want to activate
   distinct BMP feeds for event logging and route collection and, also
   in this case, reporting malformed packets via Route Event Logging
   message type may be preferrable over Route Mirroring.

   Crossed warning bound and crossed upper bound events refer to the
   received route thresholds that can be configured according to
   Section 6.7 of [RFC4271].  Also the stats counters part of these
   events is being addressed by the Definition For New BMP Statistics
   Type [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-bgp-rib-stats] document.

5.  Security Considerations

   It is not believed that this document adds any additional security
   considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA creates all the new registries in
   the following sections under the "BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)
   Parameters" group.  The registries will record type code points for
   TLVs specific to the Route Event Logging (REL) message type, as
   defined in this document.

6.1.  BMP Route Event Logging TLVs Registry

   TLV Type consists of a code point (unsigned 16-bit value) and initial
   allocations are as follows:

      in Section 5.2.3 of [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv].

   *  Type = 2: Support for grouping of TLVs.  The value is defined in
      Section 5.2.1 of [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv].
