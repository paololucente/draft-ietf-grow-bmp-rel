       Logging of routing events in BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)
                       draft-ietf-grow-bmp-rel-02

Abstract

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) does provision for BGP session
   event logging (Peer Up, Peer Down), state synchronization (Route
   Monitoring), debugging (Route Mirroring) and Statistics messages,
   among the others.  This document defines a new Route Event Logging
   (REL) message type for BMP with the aim of covering use-cases with
   affinity to alerting, reporting and on-change analysis.

1.  Introduction

   As NLRIs are advertised and distributed, policies are applied and, as
   a result, actions are performed on them.  Currently, in order to
   infer the outcome of an evaluation process, a comparative analysis
   needs to be performed between Route Monitoring data for two distinct
   observation points of interest, for example Adj-Rib-In pre-policy and
   post-policy.  It would be instead more useful if a monitored router
   could export event-driven data with the relevant information.

   The envisioned use-cases are the most diverse and range from logging
   route filtering to reporting the outcome of validation processes
   taking place on the monitored router, to isolating certain subsets of
   data to be validated offline, to report malformed BGP packets, to
   broader closed-loop operations.

Internet-Draft                   BMP REL                       July 2024


   Since no other existing BMP message type does fit the described
   purpose, this document defines a new Route Event Logging (REL)
   message type that is suitable to carry event-driven data and is
   extensible in nature.  While the message format is similar to the
   Route Mirroring message type defined in RFC 7854 [RFC7854] and to the
   Route Monitoring message type as defined in TLV support for BMP Route
   Monitoring and Peer Down Messages [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv], the
   semantics are different.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC 2119 [RFC2119] RFC 8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

3.  Route Event Logging (REL) message

   In basic terms a REL message does carry Events.  Each Event is
   logically composed by one Event Subject and one or more Event
   Attributes.

   The structure of the Route Event Logging message is the same as the
   Route Monitoring message defined in TLV support for BMP Route
   Monitoring and Peer Down Messages [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] where the
   Per-Peer Header is followed by a BGP Message TLV, one indexed
   Informational TLV and further optional indexed Informational TLVs.
   An example of such structure is available in Section 4.2.1.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv].

   One or more Event Subjects are packed as part of a BGP Update PDU.
   The BGP Update PDU Section 4.3 of [RFC4271] is encoded itself as part
   of a BGP Message TLV with code point TBD1 and index set to zero.
   Each Event Subject is represented by an NLRI carried in the PDU.

   The BGP Message TLV may be preceeded and/or followed by indexed
   Informational TLVs that carry Event Attributes, where attributes are
   bound to subjects referring to their positional index within the PDU
   or via a Group TLV as described in Section 4.2.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv]

   Speaking comparatively to other existing message types, REL does not
   require an initial flooding of information as per the state
   synchronization nature of Route Monitoring and does not aim to
   provide a non-state-compressed full-fidelity view of all messages
   received as per the debugging nature of Route Mirroring.

Internet-Draft                   BMP REL                       July 2024


   In the context of BMP REL message, and hence in the reminder of this
   document, the term Event Subject and NLRI will be used
   interchangeably.  Also the term Event Attribute and Informational TLV
   will be used interchangeably.

   The following sections will describe each component of the REL
   message in more detail.

3.1.  Per-Peer Header

   The message does start with a BMP per-peer header as defined in RFC
   7854 [RFC7854], subsequently extended by RFC 8671 [RFC8671] and RFC
   9069 [RFC9069] allowing, among the other things, to timestamp an
   Event and set its observation point among those defined in BMP.

   Because the main purpose of the REL message is to log events at the
   time of applying an action, the Peer Flags field - even if applied to
   Adj-Rib-In or Adj-Rib-Out does not have the concept of pre- and post-
   policy.  The flags are hence defined as follows:

                              0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                             |V|A| Reserved  |
                             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The V flag and A flag do carry the same meaning as originally defined
   by RFC 7854 [RFC7854].  The remaining bits are reserved for future
   use.  They MUST be transmitted as 0 and their values MUST be ignored
   on receipt.

3.2.  BGP Update PDU

   The PDU enclosed as part of a BGP Message TLV can be either a
   verbatim copy or artificial, either packed from scratch or repacked
   starting from an existing BGP Update PDU to only contain the relevant
   NLRIs affected by an Event (one or multiple).  The Event is going to
   be further described by means of Event Attributes by indexed
   Informational TLVs.

   The choice of describing one or multiple Event Subjects via a BGP
   Update PDU is because, on one hand, this does allow to not have to
   invent new encodings for NLRIs, while on the other, to support all
   types and encodings already supported by BGP.  The advantage being
   that only minimal new code, on both the exporting and the receiving
   sides, will have to be produced.

3.3.  Informational TLVs

   Informational TLVs in BMP are formalized by the intersection of RFC
   7854 [RFC7854], TLV support for BMP Route Monitoring and Peer Down
   Messages [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] and Support for Enterprise- specific
   TLVs in the BGP Monitoring Protocol [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit].
   TLVs in a REL message are indexed.

   Contrary to other BMP messages where all Informational TLVs are
   entirely optional, in order for a REL message to be meaningful, it
   MUST contain at least one Event Reason TLV and MAY contain other
   optional attribute TLVs to further characterize the Event.

   A new registry called "Route Event Logging TLVs" is defined and is
   seeded with the TLVs detailed in the following sections.

3.3.1.  Event Reason TLV

   TBD2 = Event Reason TLV (4 octets).  Indicates the IANA-registered
   reason code describing the type of the event.  The following reason
   codes are defined as part of the "Event Reason TLV" registry:

                 +--------+------------------------------+
                 | Value  | Reason                       |
                 +---------------------------------------+
                 | 0x0000 | Unknown                      |
                 | 0x0001 | Log Action                   |
                 | 0x0002 | Policy Discard               |
                 | 0x0004 | Validation Fail              |
                 | 0x0008 | Malformed Packet             |
                 | 0x0010 | Crossed Warning Bound        |
                 | 0x0020 | Crossed Upper Bound          |
                 +--------+------------------------------+

                      Table 1: Event Reason Codes

3.3.2.  Policy Discard TLV

   TBD3 = Policy Discard TLV.  The value contains a UTF-8 string whose
   value can be organized freely by an implementation.  For example, it
   may contain the routing policy name that caused the discard; or it
   may list a sequence of policies and policy nodes traversed; or, more
   simply, it could be a meaningful return code.

   On the escort of Section 4 of [RFC9067] and YANG Model for Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP-4) [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model] it is RECOMMENDED
   to organize the string as a comma-separated string with the policy
   definition name being followed by the statement name.

Internet-Draft                   BMP REL                       July 2024


3.3.3.  Crossed Warning Bound TLV

   TBD6 = Crossed Warning Bound TLV.  The length is to be set to 4 bytes
   and the value to the threshold number of the event.

3.3.4.  Crossed Upper Bound TLV

   TBD7 = Crossed Upper Bound TLV.  The length is to be set to 4 bytes
   and the value to the threshold number of the event.

3.4.  Group TLV

   The Group TLV is to form N:M relationships among NLRIs in the BGP
   Update PDU and TLVs of the same Route Event Logging message.  This
   TLV has code point TBD4 and follows the definition of Group TLV in
   TLV support for BMP Route Monitoring and Peer Down Messages
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv].

3.5.  Stateless Parsing TLV

   The Stateless Parsing TLV is to allow parsing of the BGP Update PDU
   independently from a Peer Up message previously received for the same
   BGP session.  This TLV can be especially relevant to Route Event
   Logging where the BGP Update PDU is artificial.  The TLV has code
   point TBD5 , it follows the definition of Stateless Parsing TLV in
   TLV support for BMP Route Monitoring and Peer Down Messages
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] and uses code point definitions in the
   Stateless Parsing Registry.

4.  Operational Considerations

   Route Event Logging messages are event-driven in nature so the
   general recommendation is to use them to report on specific
   conditions of interest in order, for example, to facilitate data
   mining or avoid differential analysis.  When the objective is to
   annotate every received or announced NLRI then the recommendation is
   to use Route Monitoring messages with BMP Path Marking
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-path-marking-tlv].  As an example consider RPKI
   validation status: when the objective is to report on any validations
   tatus (ie. valid, invalid and unknown), BMP Path Marking should be
   used; when the objective is instead to report only invalids then
   Route Event Logging with Validation Fail Event Reason should be used.

   There exist a definite overlap between Route Event Logging when used
   to report Malformed Packet and the use-cases for Route Mirroring
   where Errored PDUs may be sampled for reporting.  From implementors
   perspective, if one wants to implement broader event-driven
   notifications and does not want to offer exact mirroring of monitored

Internet-Draft                   BMP REL                       July 2024


   BGP sessions without state compression it may be adviceable to prefer
   implementing Route Event Logging message type over Route Mirroring.
   From a collector perspective, similarly, one may want to activate
   distinct BMP feeds for event logging and route collection and, also
   in this case, reporting malformed packets via Route Event Logging
   message type may be preferrable over Route Mirroring.

   Crossed warning bound and crossed upper bound events refer to the
   received route thresholds that can be configured according to
   Section 6.7 of [RFC4271].  Also the stats counters part of these
   events is being addressed by the Definition For New BMP Statistics
   Type [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-bgp-rib-stats] document.

5.  Security Considerations

   It is not believed that this document adds any additional security
   considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
