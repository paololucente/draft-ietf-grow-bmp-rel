		The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) does provision for BGP session event
		logging (Peer Up, Peer Down), state synchronization (Route Monitoring),
		debugging (Route Mirroring) and Statistics messages, among the others.
		This document defines a new Route Event Logging (REL) message type for
		BMP with the aim of covering use-cases with affinity to alerting,
		reporting and on-change analysis.

            <t>
		As NLRIs are advertised and distributed, policies are applied and, as a
		result, actions are performed on them. Currently, in order to infer the
		outcome of an evaluation process, a comparative analysis needs to be
		performed between Route Monitoring data for two distinct observation
		points of interest. It would be instead more useful if a monitored
		router could export event-driven data with the relevant information.
            </t>
            <t>
		The envisioned use-cases are the most diverse and range from route
		filtering to reporting the outcome of validation processes taking place
		on the monitored router, to isolating certain subsets of data to be
		validated offline, to broader closed-loop operations. 
            </t>
            <t>
		Since no other existing BMP message type does fit the described purpose,
		this document defines a new Route Event Logging (REL) message type that
		is suitable to carry event-driven data and is extensible in nature.
		While the message format is somewhat similar to the Route Monitoring
		message type, their semantics are different.
            </t>

            <t>
		The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
		NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
		"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
		described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>
		<xref target="RFC8174">RFC 8174</xref> when, and only when, they
		appear in all capitals, as shown here.
            </t>
        </section>

	<section title="Route Event Logging (REL) message">
            <t>
		The structure of the Route Event Logging message is the same as
		the Route Monitoring message as originally defined in
		<xref target="RFC7854">RFC 7854</xref> and then extended in
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv">TLV support for BMP Route
		Monitoring and Peer Down Messages</xref>: Per-Peer Header,
		followed by a BGP Update PDU, followed by Informational TLVs.
		Change being in the semantics: REL does not require an initial
		flooding of information as dictated by the state synchronization
		nature of Route Monitoring.
	    </t>
	    <t>
		The following sections will describe each component of the REL
		message in more detail. 
	    </t>
	<section title="Per-Peer Header">
	    <t>
		The message does start with a BMP per-peer header as defined in
		<xref target="RFC7854">RFC 7854</xref>, subsequently extended by
		<xref target="RFC8671">RFC 8671</xref> and
		<xref target="RFC9069">RFC 9069</xref> allowing, among the other
		things, to timestamp an event and set its observation point among
		those defined in BMP.  
	    </t>
	    <t>
		Because the main purpose of the REL message is to log events at
		the time of applying an action, the Peer Flags field - even if
		applied to Adj-Rib-In or Adj-Rib-Out does not have the concept
		of pre- and post-policy. The flags are hence defined as follows:

|V|A| Reserved  |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            ]]></artwork>
	    </figure>
	    </t>
	    <t>
		The V flag and A flag do carry the same meaning as originally defined
		by <xref target="RFC7854">RFC 7854</xref>. The remaining bits are
		reserved for future use. They MUST be transmitted as 0 and their
		values MUST be ignored on receipt.

		Monitoring and Peer Down Messages</xref> and
