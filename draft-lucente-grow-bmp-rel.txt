       Logging of routing events in BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)
                     draft-lucente-grow-bmp-rel-00

Abstract

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) does provision for BGP session
   event logging (Peer Up, Peer Down), state synchronization (Route
   Monitoring), debugging (Route Mirroring) and Statistics messages,
   among the others.  This document defines a new Route Event Logging
   (REL) message type for BMP with the aim of covering use-cases with
   affinity to alerting, reporting and on-change analysis.

1.  Introduction

   As NLRIs are advertised and distributed, policies are applied and, as
   a result, actions are performed on them.  Currently, in order to
   infer the outcome of an evaluation process, a comparative analysis
   needs to be performed between Route Monitoring data for two distinct
   observation points of interest.  It would be instead more useful if a
   monitored router could export event-driven data with the relevant
   information.

   The envisioned use-cases are the most diverse and range from route
   filtering to reporting the outcome of validation processes taking
   place on the monitored router, to isolating certain subsets of data
   to be validated offline, to broader closed-loop operations.

   Since no other existing BMP message type does fit the described
   purpose, this document defines a new Route Event Logging (REL)
   message type that is suitable to carry event-driven data and is
   extensible in nature.  While the message format is somewhat similar
   to the Route Monitoring message type, their semantics are different.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC 2119 [RFC2119] RFC 8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

3.  Route Event Logging (REL) message

   The structure of the Route Event Logging message is the same as the
   Route Monitoring message as originally defined in RFC 7854 [RFC7854]
   and then extended in TLV support for BMP Route Monitoring and Peer
   Down Messages [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv]: Per-Peer Header, followed by a
   BGP Update PDU, followed by Informational TLVs.  Change being in the
   semantics: REL does not require an initial flooding of information as
   dictated by the state synchronization nature of Route Monitoring.

   The following sections will describe each component of the REL
   message in more detail.

3.1.  Per-Peer Header

   The message does start with a BMP per-peer header as defined in RFC
   7854 [RFC7854], subsequently extended by RFC 8671 [RFC8671] and RFC
   9069 [RFC9069] allowing, among the other things, to timestamp an
   event and set its observation point among those defined in BMP.

   Because the main purpose of the REL message is to log events at the
   time of applying an action, the Peer Flags field - even if applied to
   Adj-Rib-In or Adj-Rib-Out does not have the concept of pre- and post-
   policy.  The flags are hence defined as follows:

                              0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                             |V|A| Reserved  |
                             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The V flag and A flag do carry the same meaning as originally defined
   by RFC 7854 [RFC7854].  The remaining bits are reserved for future
   use.  They MUST be transmitted as 0 and their values MUST be ignored
   on receipt.

3.2.  BGP Update PDU

   XXX

3.3.  Informational TLVs

   Optional informational trailing TLVs in BMP are formalized by the
   intersection of RFC 7854 [RFC7854], TLV support for BMP Route
   Monitoring and Peer Down Messages [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] and Support
   for Enterprise- specific TLVs in the BGP Monitoring Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit].

   A new registry for REL message TLVs is defined.  XXX
